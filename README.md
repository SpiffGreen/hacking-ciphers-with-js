## Hacking Secret Ciphers with Javascript
This repo is meant to be a javascript implementation of code written/evaluated in the book 'Hacking Secret Ciphers with Python' from my study of the book.

Note: This book summary is not intended for beginners who don't know how to code in javascript/python, this is why I excluded chapters 2, 3 & 4.

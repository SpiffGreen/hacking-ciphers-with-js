### Codes and Ciphers
A little history. In the 19th century the telegraph was created, this was used for near instant communication but this is done electronically, i.e data was sent using electric pulses. Here, a dot and dash was used to represent short and long pulse respectively. A combination of these is used to form an alphabet/character. An system for translating english to this electric pulse code had to be developed (called encoding) and at the other hand translate from electric pulse code to english (called decoding). The code to do this was called Morse Code. visit http://invpy.com/morse to learn morse code.

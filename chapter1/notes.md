### What is Cryptography
`Cryptography` is the science of using secret codes. A `Cryptographer` is someone who uses and studies secret codes. A `Cryptanalyst` is someone who can hack secret codes and read other people's encrypted messags. `Cryptanalyst` are also called code breakers or hackers.

### Codes and Ciphers
A little history. In the 19th century the telegraph was created, this was used for near instant communication but this is done electronically, i.e data was sent using electric pulses. Here, a dot and dash was used to represent short and long pulse respectively. A combination of these is used to form an alphabet/character. An system for translating english to this electric pulse code had to be developed (called encoding) and at the other hand translate from electric pulse code to english (called decoding). The code to do this was called `Morse Code`. visit http://invpy.com/morse to learn morse code.

### Cipher Wheels
Note: `Plaintext` = english text, `ciphertext` = gibberish text that hides a secret code.
A `Cipher` is a set of rules for converting between plaintext and ciphertext.
A Cipher wheel is a simple tool showing the english alphabets and corresponding indexes. This tool can be used for creating a caesar cipher.

### The Caesar Cipher
For encrypting data using the caesar cipher, an encryption key is needed. This key is used for decrypting the ciphertext back to plaintext. Here, the characters are shifted a number of times(i.e the encryption key) while for decrypting the ciphertext the characters are shifted in the opposite direction.

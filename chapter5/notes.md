## The Reverse Cipher
The reverse cipher encrypts a message by printing it in reverse order. So “Hello world!” encrypts
to “!dlrow olleH”. To decrypt, you simply reverse the reversed message to get the original
message. The encryption and decryption steps are the same. This is a weak cipher as it doesn't even require a secret key.
